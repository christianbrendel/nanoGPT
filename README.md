Implementation of the [nanoGPT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY) from Andrej Karpathy.


## üèóÔ∏è Transformer Decoder Architecture

The following figure shows the transformer decoder architecture used in this project. It provides a clear overview of the individual building blocks, as well as the tensors and their dimensions, as they pass through the network.

For more information on the dimensions of input and output tensors, please refer to the `dimensions.ipynb` notebook. This resource will offer a deeper understanding of the architecture's tensor dimensions.

## üß™ Experiments

I ran two experiments that can be found in the `training.ipynb` notebook. The first one used a smaller model, and the second one involved a larger model, just for comparison. You can see the results of these experiments below.

### Smaller model

| Parameter          | Value     |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Number of parameters | 54977      |
| Training time        | 3.64 min     |

| Number of parameters | 10788929      |
| Training time        | 49.14 min     |

Example Output
